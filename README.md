## People's Film Collective (PFC)
The Kolkata Peopleâ€™s Film Festival (KPFF), organised by the People's Film Collective (PFC), is a people-supported, independent, volunteer-led cinema festival, showcasing politically committed contemporary documentary and fiction cinema from India and Southasia. It brings together a wide cross-section of audience and filmmakers to interact and form friendships and active camaraderie over films and conversations.

The ninth edition of KPFF will screen 39 films featuring a wide range of compelling stories from India and the subcontinent. It is the worst of times as the Fascist regime in India mounts an unrelenting assault on the working class and religious minorities. As people of entire regions are coerced into silence, entire communities are othered and millions of Bengali-speaking people in Assam have their citizenship hanging from a thread. It is a time of censorship of political art, literature and cinema and erasure of history by the Fascist regime. It is a time when human rights activists and journalists across the country are being punished for siding with the people by long periods of incarceration without trial. It is also the best of times, as oppressed people fight back against state violence. As filmmakers take to the streets to make cinema on our wounded times.

The KPFF 2023 features 9 films that tell stories from the Southasian regions of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Southasian diaspora in British Columbia. Common threads of migration, migrant worker lives, organising for dignity and survival, ordinary people's resilience, resistance and solidarity in times of strife, conflict and despair bind these stories together with those from India.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
